# Delete Account Permissions Debug Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. Missing Delete Permissions
The main issue was that several Firestore collections were missing explicit `allow delete` rules, which caused the "Missing or insufficient permissions" error during account deletion.

### Collections Fixed:
1. **users** - Missing delete permission entirely ✅ FIXED
2. **profiles** - Had delete permission ✅ Already working
3. **wellness_entries** - Had delete permission ✅ Already working
4. **rewards** - Had delete permission ✅ Already working
5. **messages** - Had delete permission ✅ Already working
6. **payments** - Missing delete permission ✅ FIXED
7. **item_requests** - Had delete permission ✅ Already working
8. **subscriptions** - Used `read, write` but not explicit delete ✅ FIXED
9. **monthly_spend** - Used `read, write` but not explicit delete ✅ FIXED
10. **transactions** - Missing collection entirely ✅ FIXED (added new collection rules)

### 2. Root Cause Analysis:
- The `users` collection was the primary blocker - it had no delete rule at all
- Several collections used `allow read, write` which doesn't include delete permissions
- The `transactions` collection referenced in delete code wasn't defined in Firestore rules

### 3. Security Maintained:
- All delete permissions require authentication
- Users can only delete their own data
- Family-based permissions preserved where applicable
- No over-permissive rules added

## Test Script:
Use the `debug_delete_permissions.js` script to test specific collection access before running full delete.

## Deployment Status:
✅ All Firestore rules deployed successfully
✅ All collections now have proper delete permissions
✅ Email verification permissions fixed
✅ PayPal handle display fixed

The delete account functionality should now work without permission errors.
