### Data Schema Design

**User Management System**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: 'parent' | 'student';
  familyId: string;
  paypal_me_handle?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

interface Family {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  parentIds: string[];
  studentIds: string[];
  created_at: Timestamp;
}
```

**Deep Link Payment System**
```typescript
interface Payment {
  id: string;
  parent_id: string;
  student_id: string;
  amount_cents: number; // Deep link format
  intent_cents: number; // Legacy compatibility
  status: 'initiated' | 'student_confirmed' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  payment_method: 'paypal_deep_link';
  provider: 'paypal';
  paypal_me_handle: string;
  paypal_me_url: string;
  recipient_email?: string;
  student_confirmed_at?: Timestamp;
  student_reported_amount_cents?: number;
  created_at: Timestamp;

  parent_id: string;
  month: string; // YYYY-MM format
  totalCents: number;
  limitCents: number;
  paymentCount: number;
  updated_at: Timestamp;
}
```

**Wellness Data System**
```typescript
interface WellnessEntry {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  date: string; // YYYY-MM-DD format

  social: number; // 1-10 interaction rating
  academic: number; // 1-10 productivity rating
  created_at: Timestamp;
  updated_at: Timestamp;
}
```

### Security Implementation

**Authentication and Authorization**
- Firebase Authentication with email/password verification
- Custom claims system with `admin`, `family_id`, `user_type`, and `initialized` tokens
- Family-based access control with role separation (parent/student)
- Session management with automatic token refresh
- Server-side document creation via `onUserCreated` Cloud Function trigger

**Data Protection Strategy**
- **Enterprise-grade Firestore Security Rules** with graduated permissions:
  - Registration-safe rules allowing `initialized` users basic access
  - Family isolation preventing cross-family data access
  - Server-only document creation (`allow create: if false` for sensitive collections)
- All payment operations require server-side authentication verification
- Sensitive financial data encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3
- PII data minimization with automatic data retention policies

**Payment Security Architecture**
- PayPal.Me deep link generation with handle validation
- User attestation model eliminating need for webhook processing
- Payment record access controlled via Firebase Security Rules
- Student-side payment confirmation with amount validation
- Comprehensive audit logging for user-reported transactions
- Rate limiting and duplicate confirmation prevention

## API Documentation

### Firebase Cloud Functions

**createPayPalOrder**
```typescript
interface CreateOrderRequest {
  studentId: string;
  amountCents: number;
  note?: string;
}

interface CreateOrderResponse {
  success: boolean;
  transactionId?: string;
  orderId?: string;
  approvalUrl?: string;
  error?: string;
}
```

**verifyPayPalPayment**
```typescript
interface VerifyPaymentRequest {
  transactionId: string;
  orderId: string;
  payerID?: string;
}

interface VerifyPaymentResponse {
  success: boolean;
  status?: string;
  captureId?: string;
  message?: string;
  error?: string;
}
```

### Data Access Patterns

**Deep Link Payment Flow**
1. Parent initiates payment through createDeepLinkPayment()
2. System validates student's PayPal.Me handle from profile
3. PayPal.Me URL generated and payment record created with 'initiated' status
4. Deep link opens PayPal.Me in browser/PayPal app (external to your app)
5. Parent completes payment directly through PayPal's interface
6. Student manually confirms receipt via PaymentConfirmationScreen
7. Payment status updated to 'student_confirmed' based on user attestation
8. Budget tracking and family notifications triggered by confirmation

**Wellness Data Synchronization**
1. Student logs wellness metrics through WellnessLogScreen
2. Data validated client-side before submission
3. WellnessStore manages local state with optimistic updates
4. Firebase Cloud Functions validate and store wellness entries
5. Real-time listeners update parent dashboard views
6. Universal caching system maintains performance
